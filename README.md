While BIOL1595 expects you to have some coding experience, I know that there are varying levels of CS experience in this class. There are several Python tutorials out there that you can totally use instead for a more general and comprehensive understanding of Python, but this tool is meant to be geared towards what you will need to be succesful specifically in BIOL 1595. 

This guide is split up into two parts: part 1 covers the basics. Hopefully you have at least seen most of the stuff in this section. This part is meant to have some examples you can refer to if you ever need a quick refresher. Part 2 covers topics more related to handling data, including using popular libraries and manipulating data from files.
